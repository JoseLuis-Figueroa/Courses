# Embedded Software Development Courses.

Welcome to my repository of _"embedded software development courses"_. This collection contains a comprehensive set of courses I have completed to sharpen my skills and knowledge in the field of embedded software development. These courses showcase my ability to master new technologies and programming languages quickly and effectively, while also highlighting my strong attention to detail and commitment to producing high-quality work. The courses are divided into two groups: Firmware Development and Control Version System (GIT).

**Firmware Development.**

This section provides information on all the courses I've taken related to embedded systems. Through these courses, I've gained experience in various aspects of embedded systems, including firmware development, microcontroller programming, and embedded software design. 
The firmware development courses are divided into:

[**Arduino Programming and Hardware Fundamentals with Hackster.**](https://www.udemy.com/course/arduino-programming-and-hardware-fundamentals-with-hackster/)

Learn the Arduino platform and programming language to create a wide range of projects, from robots and interactive art displays to home automation tools and much more. Throughout the course:
- Master the fundamentals of Arduino programming with C/C++.
- Build functioning circuits on a breadboard.
- Write programs that perform basic math, light up LEDs, and control motors.
- Control sensors, robots, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices using Arduino.
- Remotely log data to an Internet of Things (IoT) platform.
- Design circuits and write code for your project.

All the codes performed during the course and documentation can be found on the [course folder](https://github.com/JoseLuis-Figueroa/Courses/tree/main/Microcontroller/Arduino%20Programming%20and%20Hardware%20Fundamentals%20with%20Hackster).

[**Microcontroller Embedded C Programming: Absolute Beginners.**](https://www.udemy.com/course/microcontroller-embedded-c-programming/)

This Foundation course introduces the C programming language using STM32 Microcontroller as the platform for learning. The course is specifically designed to provide a solid foundation for working with embedded systems using C programming language (embedded C). The course provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of embedded C:
- Importance of bitwise operators.
- Usage of bit manipulation techniques to program MCU peripheral registers.
- Accessing memory-mapped registers using pointers.
- Pointers and casting.
- Structures, bitfields, unions, and bit extraction techniques.
- Representing hardware registers details and configuring them using 'C' structure definitions.
- Usage of const and volatile type qualifiers.
- Interpret complex variable definitions involving the combination of const and volatile.
- The precise usage of const pointers, const data, volatile const, with pointer and non-pointer variables.
- The behavior of the code during compiler optimization and solution using volatile.
- MCU internal architecture and programming peripherals.
- Interfacing projects.

All the codes performed during the course and documentation can be found on the [course folder](https://github.com/JoseLuis-Figueroa/Courses/tree/main/Microcontroller/Microcontroller%20Embedded%20C%20Programming%20Absolute%20Beginners).

[**Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up (STM32)**](https://www.udemy.com/course/embedded-systems-bare-metal-programming/)

This course is designed to give you a solid foundation in bare-metal firmware development for  ARM-based microcontrollers. The goal of this course is to teach you how to navigate the microcontroller reference manual and datasheet to extract the right information to professionally build peripheral drivers and firmware. To achieve this goal, no libraries are used in this course, purely bare-metal embedded-c and register manipulations. Here is an overview of the course:
- Analyze the chip documentation.
- Defining peripheral address.
- Create registers from the address.
- Understand Cortex-Microcontroller Interface Standard (CMSIS).
- Use the debugger effectively to analyze and resolve any bugs.
- Deep understanding on developing peripheral/drivers.
