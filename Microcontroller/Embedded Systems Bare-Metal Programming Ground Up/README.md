# Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up.

This folder contains all the embedded C codes performed during the course. The course is divided into the following sections:
1. Getting Started Constructing Peripheral Registers from Memory Addresses.
2. General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO).
3. Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART).
4. Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC).
5. The System Tick (SysTick) Timer.
6. General Purpose Timers.
7. Interrupt Programming.
8. Direct Memory Access (DMA) Driver Development.
9. Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C).
10. Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).

The current tooling being used for this project includes:

- Development Board: _Nucleo-F401RE._
- IDE/Debugger: _Visual Studio Code (PlatformIO extension)._
- Compiler Toolchain: _GNU ARM._

Note: There are additional sections as the previous version of the course was added, but It does not make sense to add them.
