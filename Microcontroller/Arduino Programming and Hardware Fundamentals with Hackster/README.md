# Arduino Programming and Hardware Fundamentals with Hackster.

This folder contains all the Arduino codes performed during the course. The course is divided into the following sections:
- Introductions.
- Programming Basics.
- Electrical Engineering Basics.
- Fun with LEDs.
- User Input.
- Feedback.
- Sensor.
- Robotics.
- The Internet.
- Internet of Things (IoT).

This current tooling being used for this project includes:
- Development Board: Arduino Mega 2060.
- IDE/Debugger: Visual Studio Code (Arduino extension|PlatformIO Extension).
- Compiler Toolchain: AVR-GCC.
 
Notes: 
- The codes before 107.sprint were performed using the Microsoft Arduino Extension. 
- The following codes were performed using PlatformIO Extension. 
- The 67.Controlling_LEDs also was performed on PlatformIO and it was configured to perform debugging.
